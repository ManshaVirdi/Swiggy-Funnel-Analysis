# Swiggy-Funnel-Analysis
### Project Overview
The Purpose of this Data Analysis is to study the performance of Swiggy for the year 2019. Swiggy has over 1 million users transacting on the platform on a daily basis. Through this case study we aim to analyse-
1.	User behaviour throughout the sales funnel (L2M, M2C, C2P & P2O)
2.	Identify fluctuations in the conversion rates and bottlenecks resulting in the drop-off at any stage
3.	Evaluating the effectiveness of marketing campaigns via different channels

### Data Sources
**Funnel Case Study Data:** The primary dataset used for this analysis is the 'Funnel Case Study Data.xlsx' file, containing detailed infomation of the sales funnel of Swiggy for the year 2019.

- **Session Details** sheet has date wise session count. It entails listing sessions, menu sessions, cart sessions, payment sessions and order sessions day over day

- **Channel wise traffic** sheet has traffic (listing sessions) breakup at date level.

- **Supporting Data** sheet has additional information helpul to understand the changes in numbers at date level.

### Tools
Leveraging **Excel's** powerful features, the project includes: 
- Data Cleaning and formatting
- Data Calculations and Analysis
- Data Visualization via Excel Dashboard

### Key Tasks and Achievements
**Order Fluctuation Analysis:** Fluctuations in daily order numbers have been analyzed, with the 'Session Details' worksheet completed accordingly. Additionally, significant dates with notable spikes or drops in orders compared to the preceding week were identified, furnishing valuable insights into customer behavior.

**Traffic Fluctuation Analysis:** Examined the changes in user traffic from the previous week, investigating any potential shifts in traffic sources using the 'Channel Wise Traffic' sheet. This analysis has aided in understanding the factors influencing changes in user engagement.

**Conversion Fluctuation Analysis:** Specific conversions which exhibited fluctuations have been identified by examining overall conversion rates and breaking them down into smaller components in the funnel (L2M, M2C, C2P, P2O). Hypotheses to explain these fluctuations have been formulated, considering how various factors influenced user behavior using supporting data.
